# CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT STEP

If you are seeing "Connection Error" or "500 Error", it means Vercel cannot talk to your database.

1. **Verify Backend Exists**:
   Ensure you have a file named `api/data.js` in your project root. (I have created this for you in this update).

2. **Add Environment Variable**:
   - Go to your Vercel Dashboard -> Project -> Settings -> Environment Variables.
   - Key: `MONGO_URI`
   - Value: `your-mongodb-connection-string` (e.g., mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0...)
   - Click "Save".

3. **Redeploy**:
   - Push a small change to GitHub OR go to Vercel -> Deployments -> Redeploy to ensure the new variable is picked up.

# DEPENDENCIES
Make sure `package.json` includes:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "mongoose": "^8.0.0"
}
```
Run `npm install mongoose` if running locally.
