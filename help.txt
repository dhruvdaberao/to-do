# CRITICAL FIX FOR 500 ERROR

If you see "Connection Error" or "Server Error (500)", check these 3 things:

1. **IP ACCESS (Most Common)**
   - Go to MongoDB Atlas > Network Access.
   - You MUST have `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow Anywhere).
   - If it says "Current IP", delete it and add `0.0.0.0/0`.

2. **PACKAGE.JSON DEPENDENCIES**
   - Check your `package.json` file in GitHub.
   - It MUST include:
     ```json
     "dependencies": {
       "mongoose": "^8.0.0"
     }
     ```
   - If missing, Vercel will fail silently or give 500 error. Run `npm install mongoose` and push again.

3. **VERCEL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**
   - Check Settings > Environment Variables.
   - Key: `MONGO_URI`
   - Value: `mongodb+srv://...` (Your connection string)
